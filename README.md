Example chat application using socket.io where users can only be in one chat channel at a time.

This simple example was created in response to [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35060680/2387626) on Stack Overflow.

# Install

Do `npm i` inside the project directory.

# Run

Do `npm start` inside the project directory to start serving with nodemon on port 3000, then navigate to `localhost:3000`. Changes to `server.js` or `index.html` should cause a server restart automatically.
